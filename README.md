# Student Management System

Created a web application using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL to
manage student records efficiently. Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations for student details while maintaining data integrity. Designed the system following
MVC architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and clean code structure. Enhanced
usability with a simple and intuitive interface for managing records.
